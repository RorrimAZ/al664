How to use Webstorm and GitHub.

References: GitHub and Professors powerpoints and in class demonstration.

For the proper use of Webstorm and Github you must log into both of the accounts. Once in, go to Webstorm and create a new project. Once inside the project go to VCS , and then into version control and create a Git repository. It will ask you for a few steps and then it will link it to the GitHub account you had made. 

On GitHub, to make new a new repository, on the left side of the home page, there is a green button to create the repository, then at the bottom, add the README.md to it so that you can type in the file and edit.

Definitions:

GIT
It is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. This is what GitHub uses as its technology.

GITHUB
Where we have all of our repositories and allows us to link those repositories and make them live.

Repository
This is the most basic element of GitHub and contains all of the project files. It also stres each file's revision history.

Clone
This is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server.

Commit
This is an individual change to a file.

Push
Sending the commited changes to a remote repository.

Pull
Fetching the "in" changes and merging them. 

Branch
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is within the repository but does not affect the master branch, which means it does not disrupt the live version.

Merge
Merging takes changes from one branch and applies those changes into another. It normally happens as a pull request.

Merge Conflict
Conflicts between merging two seperate branches.

Fetch
Refers to getting the latest changes from the online repository without merging.

Remote
This is a version of something that is hosted on a server. Can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
